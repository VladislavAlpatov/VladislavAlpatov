### ðŸ˜º Wellcome to my GitHub profile
I am russian C++/Python developer and also a digital artist, have 4 years experience in programming.

Feel free to dm me if you have any questions about C++ - I'd love to help!
However, please keep in mind:
- I'm not able to assist with questions about software selling. Sorry in advance!
- I'm not currently looking to join any new teams, so please avoid asking me about that.
- If you're adding me as a friend, please have a reason and don't just say "just wanted to add you." If I receive a friend request without context, I may have to remove or block you.
- Sorry, but I won't be able to join any dev teams at the moment.
- I like to keep my friends list neat and tidy, so I generally only accept those I've interacted with and know well. If I happen to remove you, it's nothing personal!

In terms of conversation, please avoid:
- Starting every message with "Hi" - let's just get straight to the point!
- Asking if you can ask me something - don't be afraid to jump right in.
- If you dm me, please don't go offline right away!
- Lastly, let's skip the incoherent or pointless chatter - thanks!
